# React basics:

# Parcel : 
- Create dev builds 
- Run build on local server
- Performs HMR (Hot module replacement): as soon as changes saved, parcel will run build again and host on server with new changes.
- Uses File watching algorithm, developed in c++
- Caching : gives faster builds.
- Bundling files
- Minification of files
- Image optimization
- Consistent hasing
- Code splitting
- Differential bundling â€“ support older browser.
- Diagnostics
- Error handling
- Can host on HTTPs
- Tree shaking - removes unused code
- Can load in lazy mode
- different dev and prod build.
